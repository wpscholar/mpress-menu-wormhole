# mPress Menu Wormhole

## Description
The **mPress Menu Wormhole** plugin allows you to easily add a menu as a sub-menu to another menu.

### Why?

Let's say you have a sidebar menu where you list a special collection of important pages on your site.  Now let's say you want those same items to appear in a submenu off of your main header navigation.  Now you have to manage the same collection of pages in two places.  The mPress Menu Wormhole plugin makes it easy to maintain a single menu and have the changes you make to the sidebar menu automatically take place in the header menu as well.

All pull requests are welcome.  This plugin is relatively simple, so I'll probably be selective when it comes to features.  However, if you would like to submit a translation, this is the place to do it!
